## Using JIRA

Our JIRA has two main boards:
- [The Kanban board of current sprint](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=METAB&rapidView=30422)
- [Task list](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=METAB&rapidView=30422&view=planning)

The Kanban board is intended to be a list of what you are working on or will plan to work in the next month. Every month the current sprint is closed and a new sprint is created. The sprint names follow the format `METAB Sprint 20yy-mm`. This will refresh the Kanban board to get it clean and remove the old tasks. The intent of this board is to have an idea of what everyone is working on, and can be used as a visualization helper during our standups. The task list includes the current sprint tasks on top and all the other tasks (backlog).

For the next few tasks that you intend to work on, please make sure to assign the tasks to yourself and move the task to the current sprint. Simply click on the task in the task list, then click edit, and finally enter the name of the current sprint. This should make the tasks appear in the Kanban board. This should help the scrum master to see how the task balancing of everyone is, and how he can prioritize tasks and assign them to devs.

We also have a non-ending sprint named "sprint planning". If you would like to nominate tasks for next sprint, move them to this sprint.

## MetaBuild notebook

For notes related to MetaBuild that cannot be really placed in JIRA use the [MetaBuild notebook](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/personal/hoshyari_adobe_com/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={be8dd1f3-2af1-4f0e-8241-c2fe89104a0c}&action=edit&wd=target%28Links.one%7Ca75daa6b-5832-4315-8466-99aad7aa27ac%2FReadme%7Cb6e920ed-71ee-417f-bf8e-0aac09f1099f%2F%29&wdorigin=703). For example, during Meetings and discussions we often need some scratch space for demonstrating ideas. The link is also available on the [main age](% link / %}). These notes are under my account now (Shayan), but I will try to move them to the [metabuild-dev shared space](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/metabuild-dev).

## MetaBuild OneDrive folder

Use the MetaBuld [OneDrive folder](https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/hoshyari/Evbxny3vonVPskW1CKSjTxUBs64TYTsD1P7cu_oSzNTOTQ?e=Oace98) to store slides related to MetaBuild. This folder is under my account now (Shayan), but I will try to move it to the [metabuild-dev shared space](https://adobe.sharepoint.com/sites/metabuild-dev) group.

## Calendar Events

To create calendar events for MetaBuild team use the `Grp-metabuild-dev` (`metabuild-dev@adobe.com`). For example, if taking PTO include this group as recipients.

Additionally, for PTO events, please follow these settings to reduce the notification noise [credits to David Aurelio](https://adobe-torq.slack.com/archives/C014CHJLUDD/p1637660728470200)).
- Mark the event as "Free".
- Choose "None" for reminder.
- Untick "Request Responses".
